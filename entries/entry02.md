# Entry 2

To begin with, I tried to [setup][website1] [Firebase][website2] into repl, and got to the part where I was coding out the Authentication using a frame:

>      <head>
>
>        <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.16.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
>        <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.16.1/firebase-auth.js"></script>
>        <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.16.1/firebase-firestore.js"></script>
>
>        <script>
>          var firebaseConfig = {
>            // TODO: Add your our config here
>          };
>          firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
>        </script>
>
>      </head>


According to the EDP, I'm in part 5, create a prototype, you can see in the code above, I currently only know how to set up and the basics of Authentication.

What I'm trying to make is a web app in which I can record data using Firebase.
This web app consists of certain ideas, a homework tracker, a trip planner, and just to record things in general like goals and ideas similar to NotePad.
The unique part of this app is that I plan to make it RPG-game themed, so it won't look boring and plain like some planners.

I'm still currently trying to fix my time management problem, in which, my goal is to at least have an MVP in a Month, to do so I need good time management skills.
Is good to develop good time management skills as it will help to be organized and consistent as I work toward an MVP.
For a good follow-up in time management, it will include Problem decomposition, which is another set of skill I will use and learn, to break down a certain task in smaller pieces, I have broken down my Goal into 3 pieces: 1. set-up FireBase; 2. foundation of the site; 3. Add ups (design and decorations of the site).
